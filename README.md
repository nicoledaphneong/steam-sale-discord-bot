# TODO:
- Get appid from user input of game name instead of needing to know the appid itself
- If possible, make GUI so that users can have the names autofilled from a list, to prevent wrong input
- Example:
<img width="622" height="231" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30cf0d6e-10c6-4362-8345-27770b6e324c" />

- Get pricing per currency, then apply discount based on local pricing
- Setting preset of what currency user will use (get input before the loop)

# 2nd TODO:
- Implement database
